config SAMSUNG_NFC
	tristate "Samsung NFC driver"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for NFC (Near field
	  communication) devices.
	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called nfc.

config NFC_ST21NFC
	bool "STM's ST21NFC Feature"
	default n
	help
	  STM's ST21NFC Near Field Communication controller support
	  This option enables device driver support for the NFC.
	  It is used by many services. NFC is fully controlled using I2C
	  to communicate the AP chip.

config NFC_ST54SPI_ESE_SUPPORT
	tristate "STM's Secure Element protocol driver (SPI) devices"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  This enables the Secure Element driver for ST21NFC based devices.
	  If unsure, say N.
	  This selects Secure Element support.
	  If you want NFC support, you should say Y here and
	  also to your specific host controller driver.

config ESE_USE_TZ_API
        bool "use tz api"
        depends on NFC_ST54SPI_ESE_SUPPORT
        default n
        help
          Enable when using TZ API.
	  You should select this feature if your NFC product
          uses S.LSI AP and TZ API.
	  Say Y here to compile support for TZ API.

config SEC_NFC_LOGGER
        bool "NFC logger"
        default n
        help
          Enable NFC log.
          NFC log will be recorded at proc folder.
          but will not included at dumpstate log.
          so need to copy this file to log folder.

config NFC_QTI_I2C
        tristate "QTI NCI based NFC I2C Driver for ST21NFC"
        depends on I2C
        help
          This enables the NFC driver for ST21NFC based devices.
          This is for I2C connected version. NCI protocol logic
          resides in the usermode and it has no other NFC dependencies.

          If unsure, say N.
